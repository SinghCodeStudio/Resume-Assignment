					<h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
                    <h3>Internship</h3>

                    <p>
                        During my internship at CodeEvo Solution, I had the opportunity to enhance my skills in web development and work in a collaborative environment that emphasized innovation and efficiency. Over the course of a month, I gained hands-on experience with both front-end and back-end technologies, contributing to real-world projects that challenged my technical abilities and problem-solving skills. This internship allowed me to refine my coding practices, improve my understanding of the development lifecycle, and learn the importance of adhering to project deadlines and maintaining code quality. It was a transformative experience that significantly boosted my confidence as a developer.
